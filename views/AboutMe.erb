          <p id="Desc" class="DescFull">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ohiogozaimazu! I am a software engineer from Bangalore, India. My day job involves me looking at a computer screen through the day, so I like to spend my free time doodling and folding paper! <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I completed my undergraduate studies from National Institute of Technology, Surathkal in Electronics and Communication Engineering . Apart from my increased focus on signal processing here, I took part in various art and design events an organised a whole bunch of them as well. Right from Tattos on the beach to heading a design team for a theatre production - I tried them all in these 4 years <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been doing art since I was 3 when I saw colurs mixing in the candlelight. Since then, I have tried and learnt multiple media and methods such as pencil sketching, pastels, water painting, charcoal painting, origami and stencil cutting amongst others. <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp;; Hope you enjoyed having a look at it. If you have any comments or questions, drop me a mail at mmg9291@gmail.com. You can also find my work on my facebook page - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Renzuru" class="Desc"> Renzuru </a> </p>
